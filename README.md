# NC Blocked Crossings

# Description  
This final project for Data-Driven Journalism (MEJO 570) at UNC-Chapel Hill analyzes patterns in the Federal Railroad Administration's blocked crossing complaint database specific to North Carolina. The data for this project is primarily sourced from the Federal Railroad Administration's Public Blocked Crossing Incident Reporter database. It also references the locations of different train crossings in North Carolina, which can be found in the Federal Railroad Administration's Crossing Inventory Data database.

# Methodology 
A detailed methodology with the code running procedures can be found at [umabhat.github.io](https://umaxbhat.github.io/umabhat.github.io/). 

# Summary of Findings
In Nash County, regularly blocked rail crossings have obstructed the paths of first responders and caused pedestrians to climb over train cars, according to complaints logged over the past five years with the Federal Railroad Administration. 

Observers reported more than 100 instances of blocked train crossings in Nash County since 2019. Most instances involved stationary trains along CSX-owned railroads blocking crossings from anywhere between 0-15 minutes to, in one reported instance, 6-12 hours. 

More than 80 instances occurred along a Tarboro Road crossing in Rocky Mount. But most instances that occurred in the county appeared to sit along a single rail line on the Nash-Wilson-Edgecombe county borders. 

Rocky Mount is home to a large Pfizer site that sits adjacent to the rail line along which observers reported the most blocked crossings. 

Blocked train crossings aren't only affecting Nash County. Across the country, trains have obstructed the path of children on the way to school, first responders and other citizens, per a recent ProPublica investigation. 

In Nash County, one observer commented: "School buses could not get to students". 

Another noted that blocked train crossings were an "ALL DAY / EVERY DAY ISSUE".  

"This crossing is blocked at least 3 times a week," another observer wrote.
